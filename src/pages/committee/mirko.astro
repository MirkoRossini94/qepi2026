        Mirko Rossini studied physics at the University of Milan (Italy), earning his bachelor's and master's degrees. While working 
        as a Ph.D. researcher at the University of Ulm under Prof. Joachim Ankerhold's supervision, he developed a model to reproduce 
        the dynamics of charges along the DNA strand. There, he tried to capture the relevant features necessary to recreate the behavior 
        of charges in native DNA within living cells, closely collaborating with Professors Reiner Siebert and Ole Ammerpohl from the 
        Institute for Human Genetics. Meanwhile, an international collaboration stemmed from this work and led to the formation of the 
        Scientific Consortium, which is currently responsible for hosting the QEpi Conference for the first time. 
        He earned his Ph.D. from the University of Ulm in 2025.
