      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">Topic Overview</h2>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
        The QEpi2026 conference, Quantum Effects on Epigenetic Regulation in Living Systems, brings together experts from diverse 
        scientific disciplines to explore the question: “Can quantum phenomena play a decisive role in regulatory processes in living 
        systems, including epigenetic mechanisms?”. We will discuss potential answers to this question from a truly interdisciplinary 
        perspective. Although research progress and experimental evidence have been produced in different disciplines in relation to 
        this context, this line of inquiry has never been pursued in a unified multi-disciplinary effort. On one hand, much work has 
        focused on characterizing the electronic properties of DNA and various other molecules to assess their potential utility for 
        engineering applications. On the other hand, researchers have investigated the dynamics of quantum processes along DNA segments 
        in open environments from a purely theoretical perspective. What remains to be uncovered, is how these quantum processes 
        intersect with the complexity of biological regulation, particularly in the context of epigenetics. 
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-12">  
        This conference will be instrumental in creating solid foundations for an international collaboration in the pursuit of this 
        line of research, bringing together experts from quantum physics, chemistry, and epigenetics, and fostering multiple efforts in 
        this largely unexplored field.
